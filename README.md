## My process

### Built with

- HTML5: Utilized semantic HTML elements for a more meaningful and accessible structure.
- CSS: Employed CSS for styling, with a focus on layout and design principles.
- Sass: Used Sass, a CSS preprocessor, to enhance styling capabilities through features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
- JavaScript: Applied JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic elements to the web pages

### What I learned

During this project, I gained valuable experience with HTML5 semantic elements, enhancing the structure and meaning of web content for both users and search engines. I also focused on accessibility, ensuring that the web pages are usable by people with various disabilities, including those who rely on screen readers or navigate without a mouse. Additionally, I integrated Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor, which significantly improved my styling workflow by allowing me to use features like variables, nested rules, and mixins, leading to more maintainable and efficient CSS code. 

### Continued development

Looking ahead, I plan to expand my skill set by learning Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that will streamline styling with its pre-built classes and flexible design system. This will allow for faster development and more consistent, responsive designs. Additionally, I aim to dive into React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Mastering React will enable me to create dynamic, interactive web applications with a component-based architecture, further enhancing my front-end development capabilities.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - This is Sass official documentation which helped me understand it's basics. I'd recommend it to anyone who is willing to start out with Sass.
- [Fedmentor](https://fedmentor.dev/) - Great blog especially for juniors developers to develope strong accessible practices.
- [The A11Y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) - The A11Y Project is a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.
